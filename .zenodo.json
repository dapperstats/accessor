    "description": "Tools for making Access databases (both .mdb and .accdb) databases available to users without the use of Access. Three conversion tools are available in generalized formats. [1] Conversion from an .accdb or .mdb database that may be remote or local to a local set of .csv files named by the tables in the database. This tool wraps around the mdbtools package (which leverages the drivers in unixodbc) to provide one-line conversion of an Access database to a folder of .csv files. This is accomplished by the accessor.bash script, which combines two other scripts: retrieve_remote_db.bash (if necessary) and msdb_to_csvs.bash. [2] Reading the folder of .csvs into R as a list of data.frames that is directly analagous to the .accdb or .mdb database of tables via the read_database() function. This is accomplished through an included R script of a few minimal functions generalizing the base capacity of R to read data files. [3] A Dockerfile that documents a Docker image (stored on Docker Hub), which provides a stable, minimal runtime environment that automatically downloads up-to-date data from a particular .accdb database (California Delta fish salvage monitoring database) by default. The Dockerfile includes options that allow for simple high-level toggling of runtime options including the location of the file to be retrieved and whether or not an interactive R session should be initiated. Methods text included describes the bash, R, and Dockerfile script options and default values.",
